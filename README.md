# Wiki Retrieval Chatbot

The project aims is to create a versatile chatbot that not only retrieves information from Wikipedia but also engages users in meaningful conversations. 
By leveraging natural language processing techniques and various libraries such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping and scikit-learn for modeling, we aim to enhance user experience while providing accurate and relevant information.</br>
